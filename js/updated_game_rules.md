Hexic Game Report
Summary: Hexic is a single-player tile-matching puzzle game created by Alexey Pajitnov, the designer of Tetris. Players rotate clusters of three hexagonal tiles to form matches, clear the board, and create special bonus pieces. The ultimate goal is to form a cluster of "Black Pearls." 
1. Visual Design & Interface
Board Layout: The game features a board of 90 connected hexagonal tiles of various colors, forming an imperfect square (columns alternate between 8 and 10 pieces).
Aesthetic: The visual style is clean and vibrant, often described as "razor-sharp" and colorful. The interface includes a score counter, a bomb timer (when active), and mode-specific indicators (e.g., a countdown clock in Timed mode).
Audio: The sound design complements the gameplay with satisfying effects for tile rotations and clears, accompanied by subdued, loop-based background music (notably "Lapland" by QPE in some versions). 
2. Core Mechanics & User Interactions
Rotation System:
Cursor: The player controls a cursor that highlights a cluster of three adjacent hexes.
Action: The primary interaction is rotating this cluster clockwise or counter-clockwise.
Objective: Rotating allows players to reposition tiles to form specific patterns.
Matching & Clearing:
Basic Match: Lining up 3 or more same-colored tiles clears them from the board.
Gravity: When tiles are cleared, remaining pieces fall to fill the gaps, and new tiles drop from the top (except in Survival Mode). This often creates chain reactions (combos) for extra points.
Bombs:
Threat: As difficulty increases, "bomb" tiles appear with a countdown timer.
Defusal: The player must clear the bomb by matching it with like-colored tiles before its timer hits zero. Failure to do so ends the game immediately. 
3. Special Pieces & Advanced Interactions
The game's depth comes from creating and manipulating special pieces. 
Starflowers:
Creation: Formed by creating a "flower" pattern—a center tile surrounded by six identical tiles.
Effect: This special piece allows you to rotate the six surrounding tiles freely (instead of the usual three), enabling complex maneuvers.
Bonus: Creating starflowers increases the maximum time available in Timed Mode.
Black Pearls:
Creation: The rarest piece, created by surrounding one tile with six Starflowers.
Effect: A Black Pearl allows for unique rotation patterns (Y-shape or inverted Y-shape) of surrounding pieces.
Winning Condition: The "Grand Pearl Pooh-Bah" achievement (and often the game's "ending") is triggered by forming a cluster or flower of Black Pearls. 
4. Game Modes
Marathon: The standard endless mode where the goal is to score as high as possible before a bomb explodes or the board locks up (though bombs are the primary threat).
Timed: Players race against a depleting clock. Clearing tiles adds small amounts of time, while creating Starflowers resets the timer to its maximum.
Survival: A strategic mode where no new tiles fall. Players must clear the board completely. If moves run out, the remaining pieces lock, and the board refills. The game ends if the entire board becomes locked. 
5. User Strategy
Combo Chains: Skilled players plan moves to trigger cascading clears (combos) as tiles fall.
Flower Building: The central strategic loop involves "farming" Starflowers by carefully arranging standard tiles into hexagonal rings, rather than simply clearing them in groups of three.
Bomb Management: Prioritizing bomb disposal is critical, often forcing players to abandon high-scoring setups to survive.
