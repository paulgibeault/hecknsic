I would like to add a couple items on the todo list regarding gameplay.

- The starflower should move only one place when rotated.  It should not spin-until-match like the standard selection mode.

- The rotation buttons are inverted,  they spin the opposite direction as indicated.  I want the icons to stay in the same place, I jsut want them mapped differently.

- The rotation buttons should show the key binded to that direction, to make the ui more intuitive

- A simple and robust settings system utilizing browser cookies.  This would hold app settings like theme (dark/light), sound controls, rotation button mapping, high score, and other stateful needs.  

- Use cookies (or other client-based storage option) to store game board state, to enable a game to persist accross page refreshes.

- Game history with high scores list
